'Cause sometimes you just feel
tired, you feel weak

1
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.700
And when you feel weak you
feel like you want to just
give up

2
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.400
But you gotta search within
you, you gotta find that inner
strength

3
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.600
And just pull that **** out of
you and get that motivation to
not give up

4
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.300
And not be a quitter, no
matter how bad you want to
just fall flat on your face
and collapse

5
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.000
'Til I collapse I'm spilling
these **** long as you feel
'em

6
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
'Til the day that I drop
you'll never say that I'm not
******* 'em

7
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.800
'Cause when I am not then I'm
a stop pinning them

8
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And I am not hip-hop and I'm
just not Eminem

9
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.500
Subliminal thoughts when I'm
stop sending them

10
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.100
***** are caught in webs spin
and hock venom

11
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.800
Adrenaline shots of penicillin
could not get the illin' to
stop

12
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Amoxicillin is just not real enough

13
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.600
The criminal cop ******* hip-
hop filling a

14
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.500
Minimal swap to cop millions
of Pac listeners

15
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700
You're coming with me, feel it or not

16
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.400
You're gonna fear it like I
showed you the spirit of god
lives in us

17
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.400
You hear it a lot, lyrics that
shock, is it a miracle

18
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.000
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up

19
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.700
For ****zle my whizzle this is
the plot listen up

20
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.500
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle
does not give a ****

21
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700
'Til the roof comes off, till
the lights go out

22
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.500
'Til my legs give out, can't
shut my mouth.

23
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.300
'Til the smoke clears out and
my high perhaps

24
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.100
I'm a rip this **** till my
bone collapse.

25
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.900
'Til the roof comes off, till
the lights go out

26
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.700
'Til my legs give out, can't
shut my mouth.

27
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.600
'Til the smoke clears out and
my high perhaps

28
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.300
I'm a rip this **** till my
bone collapse.

29
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.200
Music is like magic there's a
certain feeling you get

30
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.900
When you're real and you spit
and people are feeling your
****

31
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.800
This is your moment and every
single minute you spittin'

32
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.500
Trying to hold onto it 'cause
you may never get it again

33
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.300
So while you're in it try to
get as much **** as you can

34
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.000
And when your run is over just
admit when it's at its end

35
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.900
'Cause I'm at the end of my
wits with half the **** that
gets in

36
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.900
I got a list, here's the order
of my list that it's in;

37
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.600
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie

38
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.300
Andre from Outkast, Jada,
Kurupt, Nas and then me

39
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.000
But in this industry I'm the
cause of a lot of envy

40
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.900
So when I'm not put on this
list the **** does not offend
me

41
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.800
That's why you see me walk
around like nothing's
bothering me

42
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.900
Even though half you people
got a ******' problem with me

43
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.400
You hate it but you know
respect you've got to give me

44
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.300
The press's wet dream like
Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

45
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.900
'Til the roof comes off, till
the lights go out

46
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.700
'Til my legs give out, can't
shut my mouth.

47
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.500
'Til the smoke clears out and
my high perhaps

48
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.500
I'm a rip this **** till my
bone collapse.

49
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.100
'Til the roof comes off, till
the lights go out

50
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.900
'Til my legs give out, can't
shut my mouth.

51
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.700
'Til the smoke clears out and
my high perhaps

52
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.500
I'm a rip this **** till my
bone collapse.

53
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.300
Soon as a verse starts I eat
at an MC's heart

54
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.100
What is he thinking? Enough to
not go against me, smart

55
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.700
And its absurd how people hang
on every word

56
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.700
I'll probably never get the
props I feel I ever deserve

57
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.500
But I'll never be served my
spot is forever reserved
